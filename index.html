            <p>
              I'm a senior in computer science with a specialization in design at the
              University of Washignton. I'm a Seattle native and am looking forward to
              exploring more of the world after grduation this spring. I have a strong
              interest in the arts and want to marry that passion with my interest
              in programming through front end work like web development and design
              or UX/UI design.
            </p>

              This website contains examples of my work and experience, both programming
              and design related. The website itself was also designed and coded by me, and
              is hosted through GitHub Pages. All the code for this site can be found on my
              GitHub <a href="https://github.com/aniharriott">here</a>.

              Please take a moment to look around at my portfolio, and feel free to contact
              me with any questions!
