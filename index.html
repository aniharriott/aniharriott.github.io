                    <p>
                      I'm a senior in computer science with a specialization in design at the
                      University of Washington. I'm a Seattle native and am looking forward to
                      exploring more of the world after graduation this spring. I have a strong
                      interest in the arts and want to marry that passion with my interest
                      in programming through front end work like web development and design
                      or UX/UI design.

                      This website contains examples of my work and experience, both programming
                      and design related. The website itself was also designed and coded by me, and
                      is hosted through GitHub Pages. All the code for this site can be found on my
                      GitHub <a href="https://github.com/aniharriott">here</a>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Please take a moment to look around at my portfolio, and feel free to contact
                      me with any questions!
